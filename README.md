# DataCenter_TemporalFlex
This serves as a repository for Data used for the paper on MIT's Data Center Temporal Flexibility. The zipped file contains 4 folders: (1) Data and Output, (2) GenX-main, (3) Input, (4) TemporalShifting_Code. It also contains an Instructions file on how to install GenX, how to run the code to generate scenarios and figures, and general information on inputs and outputs of the model.

# Data and Output
Contains both (1) consolidated data on Emissions, Cost, Capacity Investments, and Retirements for all 3 Regions and (2) Sample Output from the GenX model

# GenX-main
The current implementation of GenX that runs the Data Center Temporal Flexibility model

# Input
Contains Input parameters that will allow the user to generate any temporal flexibility scenario for any of the three regions

# TemporalShifting_Code
Contains Code to replicate the figures found in the main text
